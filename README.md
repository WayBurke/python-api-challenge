# MODULE 6 CHALLENGE - Python API Challenge

## Description

### Part I: WeatherPy
This notebook illustrated how to use the Weather API to evaluate the weather conditions of randomly selected cities across the world. Based on the selected cities, do they tell the same story for cities in close promixty in terms of expected weather conditions? 


### Part II: VacationPy
This notebook used the CSV file of cities created from Part I - WeatherPy to dervive a heat map of those city locations. From the list of cities, the ideal vacation weather cities where selected. The ideal weather condition is described as a location having  max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70,  wind speed less than 10 mph and zero cloudiness. Hotels within 5000meters of those cities were added to the heatmap with markers.
